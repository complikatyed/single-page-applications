# NSS Exercise: Dynamic Cards

### Description:

- Using vanilla JavaScript, dynamically add card each time user types in a word and clicks 'Create';
  - Card colors should alternate between orange and blue;
  - Each card should include a delete button;
  - Dynamically add listener to each delete button;

- When delete button is clicked, the card should be removed from the DOM (not just hidden);

### Lessons Learned:

Of the exercises which required us to add items to the DOM dynamically, this was one of the more straightforward.  It did offer an excellent opportunity to practice using *nth-child* for formatting the card backgrounds.
